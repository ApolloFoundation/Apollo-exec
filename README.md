# Apollo-exec

<b>!Attention! Repository is under construction!</b>

Apollo is being developed by the Apollo Foundation and supporting members of the community.
This repository contains Apollo blockchain main executable and packager.

Main executable is executable fat jar that requires Java 11 to run.

Package is cross-platform zip file containing all required config files and scripts.

Attention! This build DOES NOT contain web-ui. Web-ui now is separate package that could
be downloaded from Apollo-webui release page or build from sources.


# Build instruction #

If you have already installed ___jdk 11___, you can skip __"Preparation steps" section__, but its recommended to __review__ 
your software versions using instructions from __"Preparation steps" section__

## Preparation steps ##
   1. Download [Java Development Kit (jdk), version 11](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html)
   2. Setup `JAVA_HOME` variable to point on unpacked jdk if not set
   3. Add to `PATH` variable path to java binaries -> `JAVA_HOME/bin`
      > NOTE: if your computer has jdk 8, jdk 9 or jdk 10, you should remove it from `PATH` variable
   4. Open command line and execute: `java -version`. 
        
    Output example: 
<pre>
  java version "11.0.2" 2019-01-15 LTS<br>
  Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.2+9-LTS)<br>
  Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.2+9-LTS, mixed mode)
</pre>

   5. If ___version matches___ downloaded version, your ___java___ was __installed successfully__ and you can __proceed with next steps_. If __version
   does not
   match__,
   ___delete old version___, _setup
    variables_ (`JAVA_HOME`, `PATH`)_ and try again. __PATH should not contain few java bin directories!__
   6. Open command line, change your current directory to this project root and execute
   
- for Linux:
```shell script
./mvnw -v
```
- for Windows cmd:
```cmd
mvnw -v
```
     
    Output example:
<pre>
  Apache Maven 3.6.2 (40f52333136460af0dc0d7232c0dc0bcf0d9e117; 2019-08-27T18:06:16+03:00)<br>
  Maven home: /home/your_user_name/.m2/wrapper/dists/apache-maven-3.6.2-bin/795eh28tki48bv3l67maojf0ra/apache-maven-3.6.2<br>
  Java version: 11.0.2, vendor: Oracle Corporation, runtime: /usr/java/jdk-11.0.2<br>
  Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8<br>
  OS name: "linux", version: "4.20.16-200.fc29.x86_64", arch: "amd64", family: "unix"<br>
</pre>
   7. If ___maven version, javaHome and java_version___ __matches__ your downloaded java then
   you are able to __build and run wallet__! Just choose your OS from the list below and perform specified steps.

## Linux/MacOS
   * Clone repository using git command `git clone` or download archive file of source code
   * go to source directory
   * run ___mvn install___ 
   * go to bin directory and run ___apl-run-desktop.sh___ 
   * application should start in desktop mode
   * if you require command line mode -> use ___apl-run.sh___ instead of ___apl-run-desktop.sh___

## Windows
   * Clone repository using git command `git clone` or download archive file of source code
   * go to source directory
   * run ___mvn install___ 
   * go to bin directory and run ___apl-run-desktop.bat___
   * application should start in desktop mode
   * if you require command line mode -> use ___apl-run.bat___ instead of ___apl-run-desktop.bat___

## Command-line options

apl-exec.jar and all scripts accept command line options. To get list of available options, run with --help switch.
Most important options:

        --net, -n index of network to run with. 0 is main net, 1 is 1st public test net with stable release,
        2 is 2nd testnet with development/staging code and 3 is 3rd test net with experimental features
        --testnet means run with 1st test net. Higher priority then --net switch

        --debug, -d  from 0 to 4. 0 is ERROR level of logs, 4 is TRACE

Example:

    bin/apl-run.sh -d 4 -n 2

This command runs blockchain application with 2nd test net and debug level TRACE

## IDE

Project is entirely on Maven v3 and could be loaded in any IDE that supports Maven.
